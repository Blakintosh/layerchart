<h1>Welcome to LayerChart</h1>

LayerChart is a large collection of visualization components and utilities for [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/), built upon the wonderful [Layer Cake](https://layercake.graphics/) framework.

The goal is to provide a collection of useful but mostly opinionated components as building blocks for a wide range of visualizations, such as:

- Cartesian (Bar, Area, Stack, Scatter)
- Radial (Pie, Arc, Sunburst)
- Hierarchy (Pack, Tree, Treemap, Sunburst)
- Graph (Sankey)
- Geo (Choropleth, Spike, Bubble, Point, Globe)

The library also provides a number of primatives:

- Interaction (tooltip, pan/zoom)
- Motion-enabled SVG primatives (Rect, Circle, Arc, Group)
- SVG utilities (gradient/patterns, clipping, multi-line SVG text)
- Legends, annotations, and more.

Take a look at the various examples to or jump in installing the `layerchart` package

```sh
npm install layerchart
```

Lastly, take a look at the complement project [svelte-ux](https://svelte-ux.techniq.dev/) for a large collection of Svelte components, actions, stores, and utilities to build highly interactive applications.
