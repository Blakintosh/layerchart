# Welcome to LayerChart

## Common

- Chart
  - Uses LakerCake to setup context
  - Adds support for x and y baseline (always show 0, etc)
- AxisX and AxisY
  - Easily add gridlines
  - Custom tick format
  - Tick control (see also `getMajorTicks` / `getMinorTicks` utils)
- Baseline
  - Compliments Axis by showing `0` baseline as solid line

## Primatives

- Circle
  - `<circle>` with tweened `x`, `y`, and `r` using `motionStore`
- Rect
  - `<rect>` with tweened `x`, `y`, `width` and `height` using `motionStore`
- Line
  - `<line>` with tweened `x`, `y`, `width` and `height` using `motionStore`
- Path
  - Uses `d3-shape` line generator to support `curve` and `defined`
  - Worked as data-driven (context) or can take data as prop
- Text
  - Adjustable anchor/origin point (center horizontally and vertically)
  - Rotate (based on origin)
  - Multiline
  - Scale to fit
  - Easy offset with `dx` and `dy`

## Data-driven (context)

- Area
  - Easily add line (same curve, color, etc)
- AreaStack
- Bar
- ClevelandDotPlot
- Label
- Scatter
- Threshold
  - Calculates line, area, and clip path data to show colored areas above/below
  - `y={[actual, baseline/threshold]}`

## Interations

- HighlightBar
- HighlightLine
- Tooltip

## Todo

- Add basic line charge (data-driven)
  - Differentiate with Path and Line, although could probbaly just use Path, although might be confusing
- Add examples with animated Circle, Rect, and Line
- Consider updating Circle, Rect, and Line to support xGet/yGet with data, along with explicit `cx`/`cy`
- Consider changing `Label` to `Mark`

## Principals

- Use `r` scale for color, but allow `color` prop directly on item (with access to item, value, index, etc)
- Use `x`, `y`, and `z` scales for dimensions
  - `z` for size (depth) of circles, etc
